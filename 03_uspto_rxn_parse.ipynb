In crystallizer 21A, sodium carbonate decahydrate crystals are formed by evaporative cooling of the solution and water vapor is removed via line 22. Evaporative cooling is preferred because it both concentrates the liquor in the crystallizer and this evaporation also cools the solution to crystallize sodium carbonate decahydrate. The crystal slurry formed in crystallizer 21A is then passed via line 24 into an initial centrifuge 24A to separate the decahydrate crystals from their mother liquor. The mother liquor is separated from the decahydrate crystals in centrifuge 24A and sent via line 26 to a second decahydrate crystallizer 26A.
